  <p>A group of monk parrots currently lives in Brooklyn. How did these tropical visitors come to be there, and how did they adjust? </p>
</div>

    <div id="flexwrapper">

        <p>The Monk Parrots are originally from Argentina. In order to get to New York, they migrated over 5,503 mi by plane in order to be sold as pets in New York pet stores.</p>

  <p>Legend has it that the birds escaped from JFK airport after being unloaded from their plane. The birds then flew across Brooklyn until they were able to find habitable areas to roost.</p>

    <div id="flexwrapper">
  <p>Eventually the birds migrated to Greenwood Cemetary, which is still the most densely parrot-populated area of Brooklyn today. The spires and crives of the gravestones and church structures in the area provide the perfect balance of protection and support for nests and roosting. </p>
